            <h2>What is Shoshin College?</h2>
            <p>
                Shoshin College is a collection of people interested in offering low cost yet
                high-quality classes on a variety of disciplines.
            </p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Create space for learning and experimentation. This space will be in three
                dimensions: (a) physical: an place in the real world we can go to, (b) temporal: time
                in our calendars to engage with the content, (c) mental: space in our minds to
                think about new things.
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                In one sentence, we're interested in a Shoshin College because it's an
                expression of freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine we live in a world of post-scarcity. There is no need to work for
                survival. We have ample food and housing for everyone. What do we do then?
                Life would be pretty boring — if only humanity wasn't inherently curious
                about everything. How would we learn if we didn't have to? Maybe many
                wouldn't but some would definitely be interested in learning just for the
                sake of it. How would they do it? Would they keep the current global
                structure of academia or would they try something new? If so, what would it
                look like?
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's explore. Let's think values we value, let's build processes on top of
                them, and let's see what happens. Whatever works we can keep; whatever
                doesn't we can change. Nothing forces us to cling onto old (or new)
                processes. This is in contrast to large established institutions which have
                a lot of inertia on their policies due to past success.
            </p>

            <h2>Community Interest Company</h2>
            <p>
                Shoshin College CIC is a
                <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies">Community Interest Company</a>
                Limited by Guarantee. A Community Interest Company (CIC) is a special type of limited company which
                exists to benefit the community rather than private shareholders.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is our community interest statement, as stated in our Articles of Association:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                The objects of the Company are to carry on activities which benefit the
                community and in particular (without limitation) to provide low cost educational
                classes on a variety of disciplines, including philosophy, computer science,
                design, and meditation.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                A CIC has an asset lock: a legal clause in our Articles of Association
                which binds the company's assets to only be used for its social objectives and
                in case of dissolution to be transfered to another CIC or charity.
            </p>
            <p>
                A CIC is required to produce an annual report with details of what the CIC
                has done to benefit the community and how it has consulted the community members
                on its activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we publish transparency reports per semester on our operations and
                financial transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shoshin College CIC is registered in England and Wales under company number 15760817.
