    <h2>Community Interest Company</h2>
    <p>
        Shoshin College CIC is a Community Interest Company Limited by Guarantee.
        A Community Interest Company (CIC) is a special type of limited company which
        exists to benefit the community rather than private shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is our community interest statement, as stated in our Articles of Association:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        The objects of the Company are to carry on activities which benefit the
        community and in particular (without limitation) to provide low cost educational
        classes on a variety of disciplines, including philosophy, computer science,
        design, and meditation.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        As a CIC, we also have an asset lock: a legal clause binding the company’s assets
        to only be used for its social objectives and in case of dissolution to be
        transfered to another CIC or charity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shoshin College CIC is registered in England and Wales under company number 15760817.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        In one sentence, we’re interested in a Shoshin College because it’s an
        expression of freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine we live in a world of post-scarcity. There is no need to work for
        survival. We have ample food and housing for everyone. What do we do then?
        Life would be pretty boring — if only humanity wasn’t inherently curious
        about everything. How would we learn if we didn’t have to? Maybe many
        wouldn’t but some would definitely be interested in learning just for the
        sake of it. How would they do it? Would they keep the current global
        structure of academia or would they try something new? If so, what would it
        look like?
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s explore. Let’s think values we value, let’s build processes on top of
        them, and let’s see what happens. Whatever works we can keep; whatever
        doesn’t we can change. Nothing forces us to cling onto old (or new)
        processes. This is in contrast to large established institutions which have
        a lot of inertia on their policies due to past success.
    </p>
