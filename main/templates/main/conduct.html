            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors (teachers
                and students), with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.
                We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, welcoming environment
                for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability,
                ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, age.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to create a safe space in terms of it being completely free of
                bias and prejudice, however, we also aim want to be open to radical
                ideas and different cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to adopt a collective approach to create a safe and comfortable
                environment for everyone. Let's all assume an active role to help
                foster this.
            </p>

            <h2>OK behaviour</h2>
            <p>
                Let's all:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Participate honestly.</li>
                <li>Be considerate in our discussions.</li>
                <li>Attempt synthesis instead of conflict.</li>
                <li>Be mindful of surroundings and of fellow participants.</li>
                <li>Attempt to help if we notice someone struggling.</li>
                <li>Alert fellow community members if we notice someone in distress.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Not OK behaviour</h2>
            <p>
                Not OK behaviour includes intimidation, harassing, abusive,
                discriminatory, derogatory, demeaning speech or actions by any
                participant, regardless of their popularity and prominence.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not welcome quasi-unfriendly responses and social cues. For
                example, it's an uncomfortable feeling that one experiences when they
                ask something along the lines of "what is X" or "who is Y" and someone
                else responds with "What?! I can't believe you don't know what X is!"
                or "Wow! You don't know who Y is?!". Let's all refrain from these.
                Asking about things one does not know is something we want to enable
                and augment as much as possible—not the opposite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not OK behaviour is absolutely not acceptable and will not be
                tolerated. Anyone asked to stop not OK behaviour is expected to comply
                immediately.
            </p>

            <h2>Handling Conflict</h2>
            <p>
                Inevitably, there will be disagreements and conflict. How we handle
                them is one more indication of our skills and the quality of our
                community. It's hard to establish rigid rules for such matters, so
                please consider the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Let's try that our solutions include everyone's needs. This is in
                    contrast to assuming everyone will fend for themselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We want to be a space that will make space for something different
                    to exist. With this in mind, let's try to reconcile differences in
                    a way that multiple ideas can flourish.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Incident Response</h2>
            <p>
                We have a strong commitment to creating an open space where everybody
                feels welcomed. We take this part very seriously while at the same time
                we want to act with kindness and understanding for all community
                members. If there is potentially problematic behaviour, or even if
                there is behaviour not outlined as unacceptable by this text yet it
                causes discomfort, please consider following the steps.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Take some space. Consider creating some distance between you and
                    the person who's engaging at potentially unacceptable behaviour.
                    This will hopefully help one see the incident more clearly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Notify someone else. Hopefully there is someone in this event you
                    find trustworthy. Share your concern with them, see what they
                    think.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identify the issue. It's a good idea to acquire a clear
                    understanding of the problematic behavior so that it can be
                    communicated clearly and effectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assess response. Various levels of response are valid. In addition
                    to one's current actions, it's worth taking into consideration past
                    actions as well as their response. Did they become aware of their
                    problematic behaviour? Have they repeatedly ignored signs of their
                    behaviour causing stress? Has anyone talked to them about this
                    before?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Act. This can be either talking to them direclty, talking to
                    someone else, or even bringing the problem forward as a group
                    discussion. Eventually, the community can decide how to handle the
                    matter together.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
                We expect all community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct
                in all community venues — online and in-person — as well as in all
                one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
            </p>

            <h2>Past Incidents</h2>
            <p>
                We plan to keep a log of incidents along with our response to them. List
                currently empty.
            </p>
