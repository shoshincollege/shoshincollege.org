    <h2>Chaos Theory</h2>
    <p>
        October 2024
    </p>
    <p>
        Chaos is not randomness. It is a break in the link between cause and effect.
        When effect cannot be tidily traced back to a singular cause, predicting the
        future becomes challenging. Assuming rational economic agents driving human
        nature, and abstracting from unpredictable and irrational behaviour has left
        gaping areas for research.
    </p>
    <p>
        A growing body of research suggests that economic, political, and psychological
        systems are governed by nonlinear dynamics of complex systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course, we will dive into a successful problem-solving approach for
        chaotic systems - the theories of nonlinear complexity systems. These theories
        have enabled natural scientists to make leaps forward in quantum physics,
        computational biology, and meteorology.

    <h2>Theories of Democracy</h2>
    <p>
        October 2024
    </p>
    <p>
        Democracy is an extremely saturated word. Different people meant different
        things. Democracy in ancient Athens was completely different than today yet we
        use the same word to refer to both these things. Conservatives, leftists,
        liberals, anarchists, communists; they all talk about democracy yet they usually
        mean different things. Join us in a deep yet short dive into all the different
        theories of democracy and how each one compares to the rest.
