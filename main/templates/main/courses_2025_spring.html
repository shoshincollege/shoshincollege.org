    <h2>Chaos Theory</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Part of Spring 2025 Semester. Registrations open in January 2025.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Chaos is not randomness. It is a break in the link between cause and effect.
        When effect cannot be tidily traced back to a singular cause, predicting the
        future becomes challenging. Assuming rational economic agents driving human
        nature, and abstracting from unpredictable and irrational behaviour has left
        gaping areas for research.
