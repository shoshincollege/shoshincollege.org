            In the beginner's mind there is no thought, "I have attained

            When we have no thought of achievement, no thought  of self, we
            are true beginners. Then we can really learn something.

    <h2>
        Learning With Us
    </h2>
    <p>
        Shoshin College is an independent experimental school that’s
        positioning itself outside of the existing way of how learning and
        teaching works.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="overview">
    <p>
        <span>Universal.</span> We embrace all domains and disciplines and
        invite everyone to teach and learn, regardless of background.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Inclusive.</span> We believe in high quality work but also that
        anyone can do high quality work. We do not exclude people because of
        the quality of their work. We include them because we want them to
        improve.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>In-person.</span> There is tons of online learning material.
        What’s missing is humane interactions in a community of people.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Ever-fluctuating.</span> We embrace iteration and invite change
        alongside experimentation and impermanence.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Unaccredited.</span> We are trying something new and in order to
        explore it, we need not be tied down by the existing ways of how
        learning works today.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>High quality.</span> We could succeed in starting a learning
        institution but what’s interesting is to make it high quality and more
        importantly: higher quality than the current way of learning
        institutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Low-cost.</span> Wealth inequality contributes to a decreasing
        average quality of life for the Western resident. We are not interested
        in adding to this.

    <h2>
        Beginner's Mind
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong style="color: black;">Shoshin</strong> is the concept of <em>beginner’s mind</em> in
        Zen Buddhism. A beginner’s mind is open to all possibilities and
        thus capable of better learning. In the beginner’s mind there is no
        sense of internal achievement. Instead, there is curiosity to
        understand. In the beginner’s mind there is no judgement: there is no
        preconception of how things should be — thus there can be no judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The book that introduced this concept to the West is <em>Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind</em>,
        written in 1970 by
        Shunryū Suzuki, the founder of San Francisco Zen Center and a key figure
        in Western Buddhism.
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept of shoshin — beginner’s mind — is the foundation of Shoshin College.
