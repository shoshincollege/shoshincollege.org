            are true beginners. Then we can really learn something.

        Learning With Us
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">
        Shoshin College is an experimental learning co-operative operation
        that’s positioning itself outside of the existing way of how learning
        and teaching works.
    </p>
</section>

<div id="overview">
    <p>
        <span>Universal</span>. We embrace all domains and disciplines and
        invite everyone to teach and learn, regardless of background.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Inclusive</span>. We believe in high quality work but we also
        believe that anyone can do high quality work. We do not exclude people
        because of the quality of their work. We include them as we want them
        to improve their work.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>In-person</span>. There is tons of online learning material.
        What’s missing is humane interactions in a community of people.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Ever-fluctuating</span>. We embrace iteration and invite
        impermanence. Experimentation and iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Unaccredited</span>. Accredited institutions are great, they are
        doing their thing. We are trying something new and in order to explore
        it, we need not be tied down by the existing ways of how learning works
        today.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>High quality</span>. We could succeed in starting a learning
        institution but what’s interesting is to make it high quality and more
        importantly: higher quality than the current way of learning
        institutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Low-cost</span>. Wealth inequality contributes to a decreasing
        average quality of life for the Western resident. We are not interested
        in adding to this.

    <h2>
        Beginners Forever
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Shoshin</strong> is the concept of <em>beginner's mind</em> in
        Zen Buddhism. A beginner’s mind is open to all possibilities and
        thus capable of better learning. In the beginner’s mind there is no
        sense of internal achievement. Instead, there is curiosity to
        understand. In the beginner’s mind there is no judgement: there is no
        preconception of how things should be — thus there can be no judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The book that introduced this concept to the West is <em>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</em>,
        written in 1970 by
        Shunryū Suzuki, the founder of San Francisco Zen Center and a key figure
        in Western Buddhism.
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept of shoshin — beginner’s mind — is the foundation of Shoshin College.

<section>
    <h2>
        Our Values
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Inclusivity.</strong> Even if our new college has a specific
        location that not everyone can attend or a fee that not everyone can
        pay, we still aim to be inclusive and welcome as many people as
        possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Craftsmanship.</strong> We are fascinated by craft, by art, by
        high aesthetics and high quality. We aim to become better at what we
        do. We don't expect us to already be good, only to want to become
        better.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Playfulness.</strong> It might seem that seriousness is fundamental
        to high quality work and learning but I'm certain the opposite is true.
        Playfulness and humour is not only how we can laugh at ourselves and notice
        (and accept) our unavoidable defects but it is also how we can just have
        fun!
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Generosity.</strong> Deals and transactions are the fair way to
        work. Alas, they are also boring exchanges that make sure everybody's egos
        are respected. We value and deeply utilise fair exchanges in how we work.
        But the unexpected joy of a gift is superior.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Democracy.</strong> We aspire for democratic principles in
        governance, administration, organisation. We value consent and consensus
        and we disallow ourselves from taking actions that will cause pain to
        someone. We also aspire for democracy in the frame of knowledge. We have no
        interest in a teacher providing an expert's absolution on matters. Instead:
        may there be debate amongst everyone, one which results in everyone
        understanding the other’s position.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Exploration.</strong> What's the point of a learning institution
        unless we are curious to explore the unknown? Whether it's unknown to us or
        to everyone is irrelevant.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Community.</strong> Being together, learning together,
        collaborating together, celebrating together. We know we can do a lot
        alone; we are excited for what we can do collectively. We know we can
        make things for ourselves; we are excited to make things for everyone —
        in the service of the advancement of the commons.
    </p>
