        There are 5 ways to participate at Shoshin College.
    </p>

    <h2>
        1. Spaces and Venues
    </h2>
    <p>
        Help us find venues for our courses. Each course has different space and
        equipment requirements. We are on the look out for spaces that enable seminars,
        workshops, presentations usually with capacity of up to 10-15 people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finding free or low-cost spaces in London is hard so this is one of the most
        important things one can contribute to.
    </p>

    <h2>
        2. Design
    </h2>
    <p>
        Do you like to design? We're always on the lookout for creative ways to reshape
        our website, our brand identity, our marketing material.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a fun challenge one could start with: design a poster for one of the
        courses being offered.
    </p>

    <h2>
        3. Marketing
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are a lot of people who would be interested in Shoshin College if they
        had heard of it. Help us spread the word! We're running online ads,
        distributing posters and flyers around London, and talking to new and old
        friends who would be into this.
    </p>

    <h2>
        4. Teach a Course
    </h2>
    <p>
        The valuable thing we offer is <a href="{% url 'course_list' %}">courses</a>. Are
        you excited about something? Do you find yourself constantly thinking about a
        particular concept, reflecting on how amazing it isâ€”yet realizing that not many
        people have discovered its brilliance? If so, you should teach a course on this
        topic at Shoshin College.
    </p>

        5. Take a Course
    </h2>
